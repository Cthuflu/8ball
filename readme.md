#8ball
This is a discord bot written at 2AM that acts like an 8ball, `>roll` or `>shake` in order to use it.

##Setup
Make a file `token.key` that contains the token generated by the discord API, **without it the bot will not work.**

##Fun Stuff
Make a file `responses.txt`, then fill it with custom responses for the bot; Make each response on its own line.
